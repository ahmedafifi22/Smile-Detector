# Smile-Detector

Facial expressions indicate emotional sentiments and underpin sensations such as pleasure, happiness, sorrow, boredom, anger, contentment, and discontent. Perhaps the most common expression of human emotion, is the smile. There has been an emerging need for smile monitoring in real world development and advancement to assist humans in a variety of potential applications, such as photo selection, user analysis, artificial intelligence and applications in the healthcare industry including patient feeling conditions. Researchers and professionals involved in the development of this new technology have already expressed a strong interest in an efficient smile detection software that can provide accurate results in real-time.

This application aims to train a machine to have the same social cue awareness as that of a 7-month infant. The code will be able to detect whether people on a video feed are smiling or not in real-time. This software has many real-world applications and could be useful to small businesses and people with disabilities. The inspiration for this project was taken from a paper published by Simone Bianco, Luigi Celona and Raimondo Schettini about their approach to detecting smiles using convolutional neural networks.
